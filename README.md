# Refactor

## Introduction

Welcome to **Refactor**, a repository dedicated to improving, optimizing, and organizing existing projects found from various sources. The main goal is to take codebases built in different programming languages and technologies, refactor them to best practices, improve readability, performance, and maintainability, and prepare them for future use or learning.

This repository covers a wide range of technologies including but not limited to Flask, Django, React, Node.js, Laravel, Symfony, REST APIs, and more. Whether it's a backend service, frontend application, or full-stack project, every codebase will be carefully restructured and improved.

---

## Objectives

- Refactor external projects for optimal code quality and architecture.
- Organize projects by technology stack and architectural pattern.
- Provide clean, maintainable, and documented codebases.
- Explore various technologies and programming languages through hands-on refactoring.
- Build a growing collection of well-structured example projects.
