# Refactor

## Introduction

Welcome to **Refactor**, a repository dedicated to improving, optimizing, and organizing existing projects found from various sources. The main goal is to take codebases built in different programming languages and technologies, refactor them to best practices, improve readability, performance, and maintainability, and prepare them for future use or learning.

This repository covers a wide range of technologies including but not limited to Flask, Django, React, Node.js, Laravel, Symfony, REST APIs, and more. Whether it's a backend service, frontend application, or full-stack project, every codebase will be carefully restructured and improved.

## Objectives

- Refactor external projects for optimal code quality and architecture.
- Organize projects by technology stack and architectural pattern.
- Provide clean, maintainable, and documented codebases.
- Explore various technologies and programming languages through hands-on refactoring.
- Build a growing collection of well-structured example projects.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to clearly separate projects by type and technology, facilitating easy navigation and focused work:

### Folder descriptions:

- **backend/**: Projects focused on backend development, categorized by architecture (e.g., REST APIs, MVC).
- **frontend/**: Frontend-only projects, categorized by design or architectural style (e.g., Atomic Design).
- **fullstack/**: Projects that combine backend and frontend layers, grouped by architecture styles like Clean Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture.

Each project folder will contain the refactored codebase, documentation on changes made, and notes on the refactoring process.
