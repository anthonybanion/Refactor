# Backend Projects

## Introduction

This section of the Refactor repository focuses on **backend-only projects**, exploring various communication styles, architectural patterns, and programming paradigms. These projects emphasize robust API design, clean architecture, and scalability.

## Objectives

- Refactor and organize backend services following industry best practices.
- Explore different architectures: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets, SOAP, RPC, and more.
- Improve modularity, testability, and documentation in backend systems.
- Practice decoupling logic from infrastructure and promoting layered designs.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Flask, Django)
- Java (Spring Boot)
- PHP (Laravel, Symfony)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, Express)
- .NET (C#)
- Ruby (Rails)
- gRPC, GraphQL, WebSocket, SOAP, REST
