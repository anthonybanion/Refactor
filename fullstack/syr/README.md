# SYR Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **SYR** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Symfony (PHP)** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database. The SYR stack offers a robust and scalable backend combined with a dynamic React frontend, ideal for enterprise-grade web applications.

These projects demonstrate clear separation between RESTful backend services and interactive frontend components, enabling maintainable and scalable development.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the SYR stack.
- Showcase RESTful API communication between Symfony and React.
- Promote clean design principles across both backend and frontend.
- Provide reference templates for your own fullstack applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Symfony (PHP)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
