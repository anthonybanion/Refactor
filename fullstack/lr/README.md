# LR Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **LR** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Laravel (PHP)** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **MySQL** as the database. The LR stack combines a powerful backend framework with a modern React frontend to build scalable and maintainable web applications.

These projects demonstrate clear separation between RESTful backend services and dynamic frontend components, ideal for scalable development.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the LR stack.
- Showcase RESTful API communication between Laravel and React.
- Promote clean design principles across both backend and frontend.
- Provide reference templates for your own fullstack applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** MySQL
