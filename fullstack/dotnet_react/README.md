# .NET+RE Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **.NET+RE** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **ASP.NET Core (C#)** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **SQL Server** as the database. The .NET+RE stack combines a powerful backend framework with a modern React frontend, perfect for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

These projects demonstrate clear separation between RESTful backend services and dynamic frontend components, enabling maintainable and scalable development.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the .NET+RE stack.
- Showcase RESTful API communication between ASP.NET Core and React.
- Promote clean design principles across both backend and frontend.
- Provide reference templates for your own fullstack applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core (C#)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** SQL Server
