# MEVN Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **MEVN** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Node.js + Express** for the backend, **Vue.js** for the frontend, and **MongoDB** as the database. These projects simulate real-world architectures to provide solid examples of fullstack application development.

Whether you're new to MEVN or looking to refactor legacy code, this section offers ready-to-use, production-style examples with clean architecture and clear separation of concerns.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the MEVN stack.
- Showcase communication between client and server, and proper MongoDB integration.
- Encourage code readability, maintainability, and modular design.
- Provide templates for your own future projects.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Frontend:** Vue.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
