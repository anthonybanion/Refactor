# DRea Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **DRea** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Django (Python)** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **PostgreSQL or MySQL** as the database. The DRea stack bridges the robust power of Django with the flexibility of modern JavaScript through React.

These projects demonstrate clean and scalable fullstack architectures with decoupled frontend-backend communication via REST APIs.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the DRea stack.
- Showcase API-driven communication between Django and React.
- Promote reusable components and maintainable state management.
- Provide examples that can serve as templates for your own Django-React apps.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL
