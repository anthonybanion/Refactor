# FRea Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **FRea** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **PostgreSQL or MySQL** as the database. The FRea stack is a lightweight yet powerful combination for rapid development of modern web applications.

These projects demonstrate best practices in REST API development with Flask and dynamic UIs powered by React.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the FRea stack.
- Showcase RESTful API communication between Flask and React.
- Promote modular backend logic and reusable frontend components.
- Provide working templates for typical fullstack features.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL
