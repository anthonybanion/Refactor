# LAMP Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **LAMP** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP**. These projects simulate traditional, server-rendered web applications commonly used across thousands of production systems worldwide.

Whether you're maintaining legacy systems or building classic server-side apps, this section provides clean, organized, and real-world examples of the LAMP stack in action.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the LAMP stack.
- Showcase traditional MVC server-side rendering using PHP.
- Promote maintainable, modular codebases in legacy environments.
- Provide working templates for typical web features like forms, sessions, and CRUD.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** PHP (Apache)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS + PHP templates
- **Database:** MySQL
