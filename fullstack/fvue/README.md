# FVue Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **FVue** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend, **Vue.js** for the frontend, and **PostgreSQL or MySQL** as the database. The FVue stack offers a lightweight, modular approach to building responsive and maintainable web applications.

These projects demonstrate clear separation between RESTful backend services and reactive frontend components, ideal for scalable development.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the FVue stack.
- Showcase RESTful API communication between Flask and Vue.
- Promote clean design principles across both backend and frontend.
- Provide reference templates for your own fullstack applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** Vue.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL
