# SREA Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **SREA** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **[Specify Backend Technology]** for the backend, **[Specify Frontend Technology]** for the frontend, and **[Specify Database]** as the database. The SREA stack provides a flexible and efficient approach to building modern web applications with a clean separation between frontend and backend layers.

These projects illustrate best practices in API design, responsive UI development, and data management, ideal for scalable and maintainable applications.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the SREA stack.
- Showcase effective communication between backend services and frontend clients.
- Encourage clean architecture and modular codebases.
- Provide reference templates for your own fullstack applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** [Specify Backend Technology]
- **Frontend:** [Specify Frontend Technology]
- **Database:** [Specify Database]
