# LEMP Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **LEMP** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Linux + Nginx + MySQL + PHP**. The LEMP stack is a powerful alternative to LAMP, using Nginx as the web server for improved performance and scalability.

These projects demonstrate how to structure and deploy server-side applications using PHP and MySQL in a modern environment with Nginx as the gateway.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the LEMP stack.
- Showcase server-side rendering using PHP with Nginx configuration.
- Encourage best practices in modular code organization.
- Provide examples of secure and scalable PHP apps with MySQL.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** PHP (Nginx)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS + PHP templates
- **Database:** MySQL
