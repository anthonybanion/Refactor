# .NET+NG Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **.NET+NG** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **ASP.NET Core (C#)** for the backend, **Angular** for the frontend, and **SQL Server** as the database. The .NET+NG stack provides a high-performance backend framework combined with a robust and scalable Angular frontend, suitable for enterprise-level web applications.

These projects demonstrate clean separation between RESTful backend services and modular frontend components, designed for maintainable and scalable development.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the .NET+NG stack.
- Showcase RESTful API communication between ASP.NET Core and Angular.
- Promote clean design principles across both backend and frontend.
- Provide reference templates for your own fullstack applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core (C#)
- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Database:** SQL Server
