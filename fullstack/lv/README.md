# LV Stack

## Introduction

Welcome to the **LV** section of the Refactor repository! This folder contains fullstack projects built using **Laravel (PHP)** for the backend, **Vue.js** for the frontend, and **MySQL** as the database. The LV stack offers a robust and elegant backend framework combined with a reactive frontend, perfect for building modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

These projects demonstrate clear separation between RESTful backend services and reactive frontend components, ideal for scalable development.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to structure a fullstack project using the LV stack.
- Showcase RESTful API communication between Laravel and Vue.
- Promote clean design principles across both backend and frontend.
- Provide reference templates for your own fullstack applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend:** Vue.js
- **Database:** MySQL
